## 🧠 Abstract
In many Asian countries, rice quality and yield estimation are critical factors in agriculture. This project implements a machine vision and image processing-based system to automatically identify and count rice grains using techniques such as Gaussian blurring, thresholding, canny edge detection, and contour extraction.

## ⚙️ Features
- Automatic rice grain detection and counting  
- Image preprocessing and segmentation  
- Contour-based rice grain analysis  
- Easy-to-adapt machine vision pipeline

## 🧩 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-image
