Rice Grain Counting Dataset
===========================

Dataset Name:
--------------
Rice Grain Counting Dataset

Overview:
----------
This dataset is curated for developing and testing automated rice counting systems using image processing and computer vision techniques. 
The primary goal is to identify, segment, and count rice grains from images captured under varying lighting and background conditions.

Contents:
----------
The dataset consists of high-resolution images containing rice grains placed on different surfaces such as:
- Wooden textures
- Plain white or dark backgrounds
- Mixed lighting conditions (natural and artificial)

Each image represents real-world variations in:
- Grain size
- Grain shape
- Orientation (horizontal, vertical, tilted)
- Overlapping and isolated grains

File Details:
--------------
Image Format: .jpg, .png
Resolution Range: 720 × 480 to 1920 × 1080 pixels
Total Images: 50+ (expandable)
Color Mode: RGB
Annotation: No manual labels required — automatic contour-based detection is used
Example File: sample_image.png (4 isolated rice grains on a wooden surface)

Applications:
--------------
- Automated grain counting
- Rice quality grading and classification
- Object detection and segmentation research
- Machine vision systems for agriculture

Example Use Case:
------------------
Example Python snippet to load and view a dataset image:

import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

image = cv2.imread('dataset/sample_image.png')
plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
plt.title('Rice Grain Sample')
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

Future Enhancements:
---------------------
- Add labeled datasets for broken vs. whole rice classification
- Include multiple rice varieties (Basmati, Sona Masoori, etc.)
- Provide lighting variation and shadow-handling scenarios
